Wild Land: Organism Environment Simulator version 1.0
Tigers vs. Cats vs. Mice vs. Bugs

This project was inspired in part by Conway's Game of Life, and
also the idea of artificial organisms.

Food Chain:

1. Tigers "t"
2. Cats "c"
3. Mice "m"
4. Bugs "b"
5. Food "."

Each organism is capable of eating anything below it on the chain.

At the start, place a bet on an organism. Each one has a different payout according
to their place on the food chain. After starting, organisms will move around at random,
eating food "." or potentially other organisms along the way. Once they have enough 
health from eating, they can reproduce copies of themselves. Each movement costs
health, so an organism will die if it doesn't get enough food. The last type of organism
left standing is the winner.

This project was created over a year ago when I was still in the early stages of learning C++.
As such, it definitely needs a lot of cleaning up, which will be a future project. Also, to note,
this version was modified to work on Linux. To work on Windows again, refer to the comments
labeled "//WINDOWS USAGE"
